#### Follow PEP 8 Style https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/


### Start reading this project from file "scripts.train_classifier.py"

### Any change on function prototype should discuss with Lin/Xie First.

### All function should only do one thing. Split your function into sub function at the right time. Number of lines should not exceed 100 in one function.

### Each time you implement a function, test it with unittest. After unittest passed, commit it with detailed description. Push to develop branch when enough commits are done.

### Never push to Master branch. Only merge develop to Master branch when major update happens.

### Name variable and function carefully. It is better to spend some time to think a clear naming, rather than spending time to think "what is this".

### English only.

### Remember, code is written for people instead of machine.
